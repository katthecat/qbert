Before playing this game:
	1. Place an arrow facing top-left on your 'Q' key
	2. Place an arrow facing top-right on your 'W' key
	3. Place an arrow facing bottom-left on your 'A' key
	4. Place an arrow facing bottom-right on your 'S' key
	
These keys attempt to simulate the joystick motion found 
in the original Q-bert game on a QWERTY keyboard. I know that they're unconventional,
but this was the best I could do without hooking up an actual joystick
to the computer.

How to play Qbert:

Qbert is an 80s arcade game, featuring a swearing character Qbert. Qbert tries to jump 
around a pyramid and light up all the cubes. However, Qbert has to avoid enemies, which are
purple or red colored. Green colored characters are not deadly, but make Qbert's life harder
by messing with the cubes he has already lit up (e.g. by freezing unlit cubes so they can't be lit,
etc.). There are also lifts, which are grey-colored and float along the side of the pyramid. Qbert can jump
on these lifts to be lifted to the top of the pyramid.Advance through the levels, and get 
the highest score possible.
